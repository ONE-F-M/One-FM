		<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #8d99a6;">Note: This interview is designed to be used as a phone screen and/or exploratory interview. As an exploratory interview it can be used for prospects who are not quite ready to fully apply for an open position. Generally these are top performers who are not looking or those who have multiple opportunities. The conversation starts off as a two-way dialogue, but if the candidate is strong and the job represents a career move, it shifts into more of a recruiting-oriented evaluation interview. You can modify the dialogue a bit for a basic phone screen.</p>
