		<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #8d99a6;">Note: This is a semi-scripted interview. It’s important to ask the questions as written as closely as possible in order to insure an
accurate assessment and legally defensible interview. <b>Do not end the interview too soon or assume competency too soon.</b>
First get specific examples of job-related accomplishments to determine competency. Then measure first impressions, AFTER
YOU DETERMINE COMPETENCY. These two steps alone will increase accuracy
